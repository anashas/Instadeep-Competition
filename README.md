# The Approach used in this Competition is as follows:
## [Competition website](https://zindi.africa/competitions/instadeep-enzyme-classification-challenge)

## [My Zindi Profile](https://zindi.africa/users/Anas_Hasni)

1. Split the training file into 5 folds (source/train_folds.py)
2. Tokenize and padd the data.
3. Embedding layer( embedding dim = 128, max_len=300, batch_size=4096,learning_rate=0.001).
4. Two Bidirectional GRU layers with 300 units each.
5. One Conv1D layers with 300 filters.
6. One GlobalAveragePooling1D.
7. One GlobalMaxPooling1D.
8. Concatenate the max_pool and avg_pool
9. Dense layer with 1024 units
10. Batchnormalization
11 Dropout
12 Dense layer with 20 units
13. Check notebooks/enzyme.ipynb
14. Pseudo_labeling: Small improvement from 88.99 to 89.15
15. After making predictions, add the predicted test samples to the original training data, then re-train again.
16. Submit prediction.
17. Put your data into input folder, and your models into models folder.
18. The model was trained using Google Colab TPU
19. [App](https://github.com/anashas/Instadeep-Competition/blob/master/notebooks/Gradio_Prot.ipynb) demo using [GradioML](https://www.gradio.app/):
